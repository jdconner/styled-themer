# styled-variants

Scalable, modularized theming system for codebases that use [styled-components ðŸ’…](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) with global, local, and/or multiple variants.

## The Story

At [Remine](https://remine.com/info/careers/), we not only have *multiple global themes* (i.e. separate themes for different stakeholders, with light and dark themes for each), but *we also have multiple variants*: Size, State (e.g. error, warning, etc), and Variant (e.g. primary, secondary, tertiary) with more to come. We couldn't find a library in the ecosystem that could support such a large number of variants with minimal code, so we decided to create `styled-variants`.


## Install


```bash
$ npm install --save styled-variants
```

## Usage

**Under construction.** Usage is bound to change while the library is being finished.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Standards have yet to be set but we will set these in the near future.

To see you changes as you make them, an example app has been created. You can run it with:

```bash
$ npm run example
```
